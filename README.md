# stormy
Stormy is a bot that can be used to brainstorm and collect ideas in a Discord server.
Ideas can be collected in a channel and can get up- or down-voted.
Admins and authorized users can then repost those message to other channels by clicking one of the repost reactions.

## Configuration
Place a `stormy.yml` in the same folder as the stormy executable or specify a path to the config via the `-c` flag.
Because we use [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration, you are not limited to yaml files, but may also write your configuration
in any major configuration file format, such as json or toml.
Below is a sample config with all fields filled:
